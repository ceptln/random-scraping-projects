Note the following exceptions for Visibility. AllUsers & InternalUsers values apply to files posted on standard and custom object records, but not to users, groups, or content libraries. For posts to a record feed, Visibility is set to InternalUsers for all internal users by default. External users can set Visibility only to AllUsers. On user and group posts, only internal users can set Visibility to InternalUsers. For posts to a user feed, if the organization-wide default for user sharing is set to private, Visibility is set to SharedUsers. Only internal users can update Visibility. Visibility can be updated on links to files posted on standard and custom object records, but not to users, groups, or content libraries. Visibility is updatable in API version 43.0 and later. The visibility setting on ContentDocumentLink determines a file’s visibility on a record post. When a file has multiple references posted in a feed, the file’s visibility is determined by the most visible setting.

In a moderated feed, rather than retrieving comments by looping through CommentCount, go through pagination until the end of comments is returned.

However, if the event’s IsAllDayEvent flag is set to true (indicating an all-day event), then the time stamp in the StartDateTime field is always set to midnight in the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) time zone. Don’t attempt to alter the time stamp to account for any time zone differences. If the event’s IsAllDayEvent flag is set to false, then you must translate the time portion of the time stamp in the StartDateTime field to or from a local time zone for the user or the application, as appropriate, and the translation must be in the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) time zone.

MaintenancePlan;DoesAutoGenerateWorkOrders;boolean;Create, Defaulted on create, Filter, Group, Sort, Update;Turns on auto-generation of work order batches for a maintenance plan and prohibits the manual generation of work orders via the Generate Work Orders action. If this option is selected, a new batch of work orders is generated for the maintenance plan on the NextSuggestedMaintenanceDate listed on each maintenance asset, or on the maintenance plan if no assets are included. If a GenerationHorizon is specified, the date of generation is that many days earlier.
MaintenancePlan;DoesGenerateUponCompletion;boolean;Create, Defaulted on create, Filter, Group, Sort, Update;If both this option and DoesAutoGenerateWorkOrders are set to true, a new batch of work orders isn’t generated until the last work order generated from the maintenance plan is completed. A work order is considered completed when its status falls into one of the following status categories: Cannot Complete, Canceled, Completed, or Closed.If a maintenance plan covers multiple assets, work orders are generated per asset. If a maintenance asset’s final work order is completed late, its work order generation is delayed, which may cause a staggered generation schedule between maintenance assets.
MaintenancePlan;EndDate;date;Create, Filter, Group, Nillable, Sort, Update;The last day the maintenance plan is valid.
MaintenancePlan;Frequency;int;Create, Filter, Group, Sort, Update;(Required) Amount of time between work orders. The unit is specified in the FrequencyType field.

For example, if you enter 3 for both the maintenance window start and end, the Earliest Start Permitted and the Due Date will be 3 days before and 3 days after, respectively, the Suggested Maintenance Date on each work order. If the maintenance window fields are left blank, the service appointment date fields list their work order’s suggested maintenance date.
MaintenancePlan;NextSuggestedMaintenanceDate;date;Create, Filter, Group, Sort, Update;The suggested date of service for the first work order (not the date the work order is created). This corresponds to the work order’s SuggestedMaintenanceDate. You can use this field to enforce a delay before the first maintenance visit (for example, if monthly maintenance should begin one year after the purchase date). Its label in the user interface is Date of the first work order in the next batch.For example, if you want the first maintenance visit to take place on May 1, enter May 1. When you generate work orders, the earliest work order will list a suggested maintenance date of May 1, and the dates on the later work orders will be based on the GenerationTimeframe and Frequency. Important Maintenance assets also list a NextSuggestedMaintenanceDate, which is initially inherited from the maintenance plan. If the plan has maintenance assets, this date auto-updates on the maintenance assets after each batch is generated, but doesn’t update on the maintenance plan itself because batch timing is calculated at the maintenance asset level. If the plan doesn’t have maintenance assets, this date auto-updates on the maintenance plan after each batch is generated.

To change pre-existing maintenance plan generation methods, either delete the work orders and regenerate them or delete the maintenance plan and recreate it with the needed generation methods. If Work Order Generation Method is set to One work order per asset, you can’t set a Service Appointment Generation Method. If Work Order Generation Method is set to One work order line item per asset, you must select a Service Appointment Generation Method.

One work order per asset One work order line item per asset If your existing maintenance plans have work orders or work order line items associated with them, you can’t change their generation methods. To change pre-existing maintenance plan generation methods, either delete the work orders and regenerate them or delete the maintenance plan and recreate it with the needed generation methods. If Work Order Generation Method is left as None, the generation is defaulted to one work order per asset. When One work order line item per asset is set, and all maintenance assets have the same Next Suggested Maintenance Date on the maintenance plan, they are grouped in one work order. However, if maintenance assets have different Next Suggested Maintenance Dates, multiple work orders are created for each date. If Work Order Generation Method is set to One work order per asset, you can’t set a Service Appointment Generation Method.
MaintenancePlan;WorkOrderGenerationStatus;picklist;Defaulted on create, Filter, Group, Nillable, Restricted picklist, Sort;(Read Only) Indicates the status of work order generation: NotStarted—the default value, work order generation has not started InProgress—work order generation is underway Completed—work order generation is complete Unsuccessful—it was not possible to generate work orders You can generate only one batch at a time.
